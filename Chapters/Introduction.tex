Diagnostics of MOS structure has been subject of extensive research in
recent decades and now is at the stage-routine use. At present many
methods of determining the parameters of MOS structure can be
considered as closed as evidenced by the extensive monographies
published in this area,~\cite{I.1, I.2, I.3, I.4}. At the same time
the professional instrumentation for the determination of the
parameters of MOS structure is available, which is used for rapid
diagnostics of the technology of semiconductor devices and integrated
circuits. Many technological processes currently used in the
production of discrete semiconductor devices and integrated circuits
based on silicon are well investigated, and high reproducibility of
parameters is achieved, however, there are still areas where
improvements in diagnostics of semiconductor devices using MOS
structures is not completed.

Aiming at enhancing the production efficiency there is still a
tendency to use silicon wafers of larger diameters. In connection with
the issue of yield it brings the requirement of statistical approach
to evaluation of tested parameters of individual structures. Measured
parameters of test structures are closely related to values of
technological parameters achieved in the production and the
functionality of finished devices depends on a number of individual
technological steps that vary in certain tolerance limits. Tolerance
intervals of technology parameters become important issue with
increasing density of the integration and related decreasing of the
size of individual integrated elements. Automation of production is
typically related to high volume of the production, efficiency of
which is ensured in its greatest extent by the technology. A detailed
analysis of technological operations is far from simple and requires
large volume of experiments and attempts. It is necessary to
efficiently record the results of these experiments and use computers
for calculations, where the volume of recorded and calculated data
requires the use of database systems. There are number of mathematical
methods which are suitable for this purpose and available program
packages that address the analysis of technological
processes~\cite{I.5}. Heuristic approach to addressing functionality
of the products probably prevails in the production of integrated
circuits. Clarification of dependencies of some parameters may lead to
more exact management decisions by controlling the technology devices.

\par In this work, we tried to make available the information on
spatial distribution of some parameters of MOS structures on silicon
wafer focusing on the ion implantation, that by creating inhomogeneous
depth distribution of the dopant atoms in the semiconductor requires
adapting the measurement methods to this condition. Planar display of
the MOS structure parameters is based on a large number of
measurements and data processing, and the application of the
capacitance methods for testing the entire silicon wafer requires
building adequate means for collecting, processing and displaying of
data. Some of the examined parameters exhibit geometrical symmetry and
other randomly moving in a certain range of values. Thus planar
display of the examined parameters provides rapid and transparent
information about the quality of individual technological steps, the
value of which examined parameter depends. At the same time it is
possible, by means of this visual information, to create an overview
of the fluctuations of the parameters examined on silicon wafer and
disregard randomly measured extreme values.

\par The further continuation of this study should be searching
relationships between the parameters of the test structures of
different types (e.g. MOS structure, transistor structures) with a
focus on improving the yield of the production of integrated
circuits. Probably it would possible, in the light of knowledge of the
degree of dependence between parameters, to determine what change of a
technological parameter affects the functionality of the produced
devices.

\par This work comprises a number of areas of scientific research that
can be listed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item{basics of used physical methods and interpretation of results}
\item{automation of the experiment}
\item{use of numerical mathematics for solving physical equations and
  data processing}
\item{programming}.
\end{itemize}

\par Chapter 1 provides an overview of the current state of research
problems and deals with the ideal and real MOS structure. To obtain
information on the physical processes in an ideal MOS structure we
numerically solved the one-dimensional Poisson's equation for
inhomogeneous distribution of impurities in semiconductor and at the
same time we have gained the theoretical capacity-voltage curves of
MOS structure. Chapter 2 comprises objectives of this
thesis. Measurement methods and procedures to determine certain
parameters of MOS structures are described in Chapter 3 and 4. In
doing so, the method used in the past on Department of semiconductor
integrated circuits and structures were developed, and new methods,
yet not used on Department, introduced (Q-C method, method CCT
constant width of space charge). Chapter 5 contains some idea of
implementation of automated data collection and
pre-processing. Problems of that data structures, data files,
protection of measured data against loss and manipulation of
individual records are solved.  At the same time some solutions of the
problems related to the automation of the experiment are also
mentioned in this section. Despite the fact that this range of issues
is not directly related to the physical aspect of the measurements, it
must be emphasized that without systematic solution it would be
practically impossible to implement efficient automated workplace
tracking spatial distribution of electro-physical parameters of MOS
structures. Processing of measured data and displaying the results of
the spatial distribution of the parameters is in Chapter 6 and Chapter
7 contains a table with the results of the experiment. At the same
time the results of the examination of cross-correlation of certain
parameters of the MOS structure are also shown.

\par Programs are written mainly in C, and only some subroutines, to
process data and to solve physical equations numerically, use the
programming language Fortran. The whole system of programs was
developed under the operating system MS DOS\@. Transfer of the programs
to other operating system would require solution of the following
problems:
\begin{itemize}
\item IMS-2 (IEEE-488) bus control
\item Porting of the file processing
\item Handling of graphical images
\end{itemize}

\par To improve clarity of the text some sub-sections were moved to
the amendments. The work contains a large number of images which help
to complete the text and themselves provide large amount of
information.
