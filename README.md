Doctoral Thesis: Electrophysical properties of the MOS structure with implanted bulk

This thesis is devoted to the description of automated working set-up features for MOS
structure evaluation. Using automated HF, LF, QC and CCT methods the homogenity
of doping profile, lifetime profile, density of interface states, flaband voltage and oxide
thickness was investigated, with special attention given to the study of MOS structures
with ion-implanted impurity distribution. The homogeneity of investigated parameters
can be depicted by means of two-dimensional color pictures providing the operator with
fast overview of the parameters distribution and fluctuations.
