This thesis is devoted to the description of automated working set-up
features for MOS structure evaluation. Using automated HF, LF, QC and
CCT methods the homogeneity of doping profile, lifetime profile,
density of interface states, flatband voltage and oxide thickness was
investigated, with special attention given to the study of MOS
structures with ion-implanted dopants. The homogeneity of investigated
parameters can be depicted by means of two-dimensional color pictures
providing the operator with fast overview of the parameter's
distribution and fluctuations.
